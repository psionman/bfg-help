## File formats

[PBN, Portable Bridge Notation](http://tistis.nl/pbn/) is an open format and the most commonly used for saving and transferring data  relating to bridge events and boards. It is used, for example by BridgeWebs.

LIN is a proprietary format used by [BBO](https://www.bridgebase.com). You will  need to use this format if you wish to load your board into the BBO system.

This is a [web site](http://johnfromarran.org.uk/Bridge/PbnToLin.html) where you can convert a PBN file to the LIN format.
