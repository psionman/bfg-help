# Introduction

Bid for Game is a set of resources aimed at helping beginners at Bridge, or those wishing to develop their skills.

The application has been developed to answer the specific requirements of those new to Acol and new or developing partnerships that wish to undertake focussed practice.

The main benefits of Bid for Game are:

* the bidding system is Acol;
* in bidding practice you can get an explanation of why a bid is made;
* you can reveal the hands to better understand why certain actions were taken;
* you can practice on your own or with a partner;
* if you  wish to repeat and action, you may decide to restart the board, replay the board, or undo any action or actions, thus helping to understand the implications of a particular action.

<!-- Here, you will find two tools designed to give you practice at bidding: [*Solo*](solo) where you can practice on your own; and *Duo* where you and your partner can bid on hands.

We hope that our blog will give you help and encouragement in your learning journey. -->

## Accounts

In order to access the application you will need to log in (and sign up the first time you use it). That is because the web-site needs to know that it's you in order to work properly. We collect the minimum of data and will never share your data or use your details for any purpose other than the functioning of the web-site and, in particular, not for marketing purposes.

Bid for Game is currently free, but if the number of users gets above a certain threshold there may be a small annual charge for access (because we will need to buy extra resources). If this should occur, users that have not provided an email address will not be able to use the system. Users with an email address will be offered the opportunity to subscribe.

If you have not already signed up now is the time to do so. Detailed help is on [this page](your_account
